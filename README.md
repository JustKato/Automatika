# Automatika

## Description
A plugin for minecraft CraftBukkit/Spigot/PaperMC that adds new machinery to the game to help with automation

## Items
#### Vaccum Hopper
The vaccum hopper attracts items and once they are close enough it 
will suck them in it is highly recommended to be placed level with 
the ground
#### Block Breaker
Apply a redstone signal and it will break the block in front of it, 
add any item in the empty slot from the block breaker's inventory to 
upgrade it's mine capabilities.  
Breaking diamond_ore with an empty block breaker is not possible as
it will simulate breaking the diamond ore with an empty hand.

#### Block Placer
Once a redstone signal is applied it will place the block from inside
of it's inventory, if it doesn't have a valid block ( an item would be invalid )
it will make a failure sound, the same applies if the front of the block is
being obscured by another.
